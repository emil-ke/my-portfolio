		<p>
			This is a work-in-progress third-person survival game made in Godot
			4. I've mostly focused on systems: dialogue, AI, item and inventory
			logic, randomized loot, etc. All visuals are very crude, animations
			are placeholders, and the level is just a greyboxed test world.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is certainly not in a demo-ready state. Still, it’s the most
			complex project I’ve worked on so far. Implemented systems include:
			a working dialogue system, a functional (though basic) enemy finite
			state machine AI (which I plan to rewrite using GOAP), an inventory
			system with resource and weapon logic, and a crafting system that's
			currently basic but wired. Loot is randomized throughout the levels
			with manually set spawn points using weighted probabilities (e.g.,
			ammo boxes generate a random amount of bullets between 1 and 7, with
			rare values weighted accordingly). The aiming system includes
			realistic-ish swaying and weapon recoil; the shooting system
			includes proper ammo handling, shooting sounds, and empty-mag click
			feedback. The flashlight system includes toggling and movement sway,
			as well as randomized battery flickers. The current testing world is
			made up of simple blocked-out houses, a gas station, etc. Zombies
			float toward the player (they're not animated yet), and can be shot
			and killed.

		<p>While making this I've also learned some Blender.</p>

			The following "mechanics demo" leaves much to be desired. It is
			difficult to showcase my work in this case because I have almost
			exclusively worked on non-visual things.
