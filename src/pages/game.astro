			(Update October 2025: I've since switched to Unreal Engine 5 for
			this projects, so I'm currently rewriting everything. I'm also
			redesigning the architecture and reimagining some features.)
		</p>

		<p>
			(Written in August 2025:) This is a work-in-progress third-person
			survival game made in Godot 4. I've mostly focused on systems:
			dialogue, AI, item and inventory logic, randomized loot, etc. All
			visuals are very crude, animations are placeholders, and the level
			is just a greyboxed test world.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is certainly not in a demo-ready state. Still, it’s the most
			complex project I’ve worked on so far. Implemented systems include:
			a working dialogue system, a functional (though basic) enemy finite
			state machine AI (which I plan to rewrite using GOAP), an inventory
			system with resource and weapon logic, and a crafting system that's
			currently basic but wired. Loot is randomized throughout the levels
			with manually set spawn points using weighted probabilities (e.g.,
			ammo boxes generate a random amount of bullets between 1 and 7, with
			rare values weighted accordingly). The aiming system includes
			realistic-ish swaying and weapon recoil; the shooting system
			includes proper ammo handling, shooting sounds, and empty-mag click
			feedback. The flashlight system includes toggling and movement sway,
			as well as randomized battery flickers. The current testing world is
			made up of simple blocked-out houses, a gas station, etc. Zombies
			float toward the player (they're not animated yet), and can be shot
			and killed.
		</p>

		<p>
			While making this, I've learned some Blender as well, modeling,
			texturing, animation, and all that jazz.

			The following "mechanics demo" leaves much to be desired. It is
			difficult to showcase my work in this case because I have almost
			exclusively worked on non-visual things.
