			<p class="desc">
				A command-line poetry generator that uses certain poetic devices
				(assonance, primarily) to create semantically oblivious verses.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even though the results are often very janky and nonsensical, if
				you pick your keywords carefully it can spit out surprisingly
				cohesive poems with a fragmented, ambiguous tone, making it feel
				deliberate rather than accidental, at times. It's like a kind of
				Rorschach blot of syntax, carrying the body of language without
				the soul, and yet meaning can emerge through the cracks (e.g.,
				"where agar attacks, the ability waits").
			</p>
			<p>
				Not to sound all la-di-da pretentious or whatever but I think
				the divide between nonsense and sense is itself interesting,
				which is why I built this. Humans are nearly pathologically
				allergic to senselessness. We fill in blanks compulsively. We
				see faces in power outlets. I.e. nonesense often gets
				metabolized into coherence, even if the intent of a sentence is
				utterly meaningless (Chomsky famously constructed, "Colorless
				green ideas sleep furiously," as an exmaple of a
				grammatically-correct, senseless statement. John Hollander,
				inspired by it, came up with this poem: "Curiously deep, the
				slumber of crimson thoughts: / While breathless, in stodgy
				viridian / Colorless green ideas sleep furiously").
			</p>

			<p>
				As for who it works: A wordbank (JSON) is built from the NLTK
				Gutenberg corpus, a collection of public domain books; only
				words with a high enough occurrence frequency are included, and
				the most common ones are filtered out; manually-constructed line
				templates are filled with the user's keywords as well as
				algorithmically picked words from the wordbank, in which word
				choice is driven by vowel overlap (assonance), giving the output
				a kind of singsongy feel.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'll probably port this—in its faulty, sometimes ungrammatical
				state—into the game I'm working on (<a
					href="/game"
					class="accentLink">Drown</a
				>). It would make sense as an in-world handheld computer. Since
				the game's set in a dystopian future, the strangeness of the
				language would fit.
